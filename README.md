# CEF.swift

[![Carthage compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Carthage-compatible-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

Swift bindings for the [Chromium Embedded Framework](https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/).

### Requirements

Xcode 9, Swift 4.0 (see notes below)<br/>
Supported target platforms: macOS 10.9+

Required tools: jq, xcpretty, lxml<br/>
To set up your environment:

```
$ brew install jq
$ gem install xcpretty
$ pip install lxml
```

### How to build

##### The easy way

You can now build CEF.swift using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage). Just add the following line to your `Cartfile`:

```
github "lvsti/CEF.swift" "<branch_specifier>"
```

(For the `branch_specifier`, see the notes on branches below.)

Note that the bootstrap build will take quite some time as CEF.swift has to fetch and build external dependencies as well.

##### The oldschool way

1. fetch this repo
2. switch to the appropriate branch in CEF.swift to match the CEF distribution (see notes below)
3. run `scripts/setup.sh` from the repo root
4. now you are ready to compile the CEF.swift framework

### CEF branches

CEF is developed on multiple branches simultaneously, which differ in API and functionality (see [Spotify OpenSource](http://opensource.spotify.com/cefbuilds/index.html) and [ChromeStatus](https://chromestatus.com/features)). CEF.swift aims at supporting the current stable release branch and a couple more of earlier releases. For any CEF branch `NNNN`, the corresponding CEF.swift branch is named `cef_NNNN`.

Currently supported branches:

### Getting started

Check out the (pretty skinny) CEFDemo app under `Samples/CEFDemo` to get the basic idea of how a CEF-based app should look like.
The CEFDemo runs in multi-process mode. It will load google.com and then quickly changes to a string of JSON, to demostrate how to register Native API for JS.
For more inspiration, take a look at the `cefsimple` and `cefclient` apps shipped with the CEF binary distribution.
